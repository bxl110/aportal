These are just guidelines, not rules, so use your best judgment and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.</p>
<p>Also, make sure to check out the <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external nofollow noreferrer">Contributing to Open Source on GitHub</a> guide.</p>
<h2 id="Submitting-Issues"><a href="#Submitting-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Submitting Issues"></a>Submitting Issues</h2><p>You can create an issue <a href="https://github.com/vimeo/player.js/issues/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener external nofollow noreferrer">here</a>, but before you do, follow these guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>We fire lots of errors to help you debug, so make sure you use a <code>try...catch</code> around the Player constructor, and <code>.catch()</code> on all promises.</li>
<li>Make sure that you are using the latest version.</li>
<li>Make sure to include the browser(s) where you are seeing the issue.</li>
<li>Include a link to the page that has the issue. Even better, create a test case using <a href="https://codepen.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener external nofollow noreferrer">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener external nofollow noreferrer">JSFiddle</a>, or something similar.</li>
<li>Please set up a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/how-do-i-set-up-my-profile-picture" target="_blank" rel="noopener external nofollow noreferrer">profile picture</a> to make yourself recognizable and so we can all get to know each other better.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Pull-Requests"><a href="#Pull-Requests" class="headerlink" title="Pull Requests"></a>Pull Requests</h2><p>Before you send a pull request, make sure you follow these guidelines:</p>
<ul>

<li>If you are fixing a bug, please describe the issue and provide a test case.</li>
<li>Don’t forget to add tests!</li>
