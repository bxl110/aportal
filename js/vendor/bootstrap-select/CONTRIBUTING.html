<p>Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of<br>the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return,<br>they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing<br>patches and features.</p>
<h2 id="Using-the-issue-tracker"><a href="#Using-the-issue-tracker" class="headerlink" title="Using the issue tracker"></a>Using the issue tracker</h2><p>The issue tracker is the preferred channel for <a href="#bug-reports">bug reports</a>,<br><a href="#feature-requests">features requests</a> and submitting pull requests, but please<br>respect the following restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Please <strong>do not</strong> use the issue tracker for personal support requests (use<br><a href="https://stackoverflow.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener external nofollow noreferrer">Stack Overflow</a> or IRC).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Please <strong>do not</strong> derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and<br>respect the opinions of others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Bug-reports"><a href="#Bug-reports" class="headerlink" title="Bug reports"></a>Bug reports</h2><p>A bug is a <em>demonstrable problem</em> that is caused by the code in the repository.<br>Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!</p>
<p>Guidelines for bug reports:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Use the GitHub issue search.</strong> Check if the issue has already been<br>reported.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Check if the issue has been fixed.</strong> Try to reproduce it using the<br>latest <code>master</code> or development branch in the repository.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Provide environment details.</strong> Provide your operating system, browser(s),<br>jQuery version, Bootstrap version, and bootstrap-select version.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Create an isolated and reproducible test case.</strong> Create a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external nofollow noreferrer">reduced test<br>case</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Include a live example.</strong> Use <a href="https://developer.snapappointments.com/bootstrap-select/playground/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external nofollow noreferrer">this Plunker debugging template</a> to share your isolated test cases. You can also make use of <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external nofollow noreferrer">jsFiddle</a> or <a href="https://jsbin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external nofollow noreferrer">JS Bin</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A good bug report shouldn’t leave others needing to chase you up for more<br>information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is<br>your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS<br>experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these<br>details will help people to fix any potential bugs.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Short and descriptive example bug report title</p>
<p>A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If<br>suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.</p>
<ol>
<li>This is the first step</li>
<li>This is the second step</li>
<li>Further steps, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p><code>&lt;url&gt;</code> - a link to the reduced test case</p>
<p>Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being<br>reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as<br>causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their<br>merits).</p>
</blockquote>
